# Highly-Confidential-security-system
Highly Confidential Security System(HCSS) is a web application which uses a highly secure encryption mechanism 
thus providing a high security system for the users to store confidential data. The idea is to maintain a master 
password using which the user can access all other stored passwords. The application can keep track of passwords 
for credit cards, bank accounts, confidential photos, music and video, very valuable scanned copies, driving license 
and passport numbers, and insurance policy numbers and other piece of confidential information.

The project uses AES Encryption for encrypting user information
